# Sensr-utils

We get a lot of requests for features that can be implemented using the Sensr API.  I decided to start
creating some utils that use the API with the hope that our users can extend these or maybe even create
better versions of them.  The first one I'm doing is called get-images.rb and it will pull down the images
from a Sensr.net camera.

## Other ideas?

* Gif generator
* Time lapse generator

Thanks to [Yacin][yacc] for [creating this API][tutorial] in the first place!
